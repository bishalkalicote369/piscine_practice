üìå What is C Programming?
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language.

Developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs to build the UNIX operating system.

Known as the mother of all programming languages.

Still widely used and very popular (alongside Java).

‚úÖ Why Should You Learn C?
Helps build a strong foundation in programming.

Teaches structured programming and how memory works.

Skills in C make it easier to learn other languages like C++, Java, and Python.

Allows low-level programming, which means working closer to hardware and memory.

üí° Key Facts About C:
Used to create UNIX OS.

Successor of the B language.

Standardized by ANSI in 1988.

Used in both system software and application software.

What makes it special? ‚Üí Simple syntax, fast performance, hardware-level access.

C Programming Language Overview
Introduction to C
C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs for developing the UNIX operating system. The language was first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie released the first public description of the C language‚Äîknown as the K&R standard.

C quickly became the foundation for many UNIX applications and has remained one of the most widely used professional programming languages.

Why C Became Popular
Easy to learn

Structured language

Produces efficient programs

Supports low-level memory manipulation

Portable across platforms

Facts About C
Invented to develop the UNIX OS

Successor of B language

Formalized in 1988 by ANSI (American National Standards Institute)

Basis of most modern operating systems

Used to write Linux OS and MySQL

Foundation for many modern languages: C++, Java, Python

Why Use C?
Produces fast, low-level code close to assembly

Ideal for system development and resource-constrained environments

Common Use Cases:

Operating systems

Compilers and Interpreters

Text editors

Network drivers

Databases

Utilities and tools

Advantages of C
Efficiency and Speed
Direct hardware access and low-level memory management.

Portability
Runs across different machines with little to no modification.

Hardware Control
Pointers and manual memory management allow precise control.

Standard Libraries
Includes built-in functions for I/O, math, strings, etc.

Structured Programming
Encourages clear modular code using functions, loops, conditionals.

Procedural Language
Simple and easy to understand for many tasks.

Versatility
From system-level tools to high-level applications.

Drawbacks of C
Manual Memory Management ‚Äì Prone to memory leaks.

No Object-Oriented Features ‚Äì No support for classes, inheritance.

No Garbage Collection ‚Äì Developers must manage memory manually.

No Built-in Exception Handling ‚Äì All errors must be handled manually.

Applications of C
System Software ‚Äì OS kernels, firmware, drivers.

Embedded Systems ‚Äì Microcontrollers, industrial control systems.

Compilers/Interpreters ‚Äì GCC, Python interpreter parts.

Databases ‚Äì MySQL, Oracle parts.

Networking ‚Äì Protocols, routers, utilities.

Game Development ‚Äì Game engines and tools.

Scientific Applications ‚Äì Simulations, numerical computing.

Text Editors & IDEs ‚Äì Vim, Emacs.

Getting Started with C
Structure of a C Program
Header Files
Include standard libraries with #include.

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <limits.h>
Macros and Constants (Optional)

c

#define PI 3.14159
Global Declarations (Optional)

c

int globalVariable;
void sampleFunction();
Main Function
The entry point of every C program.

c

int main() {
   float radius = 5.0;
   float area = PI * radius * radius;
   printf("Area of the circle: %f\n", area);
   return 0;
}
Output:

arduino

Area of the circle: 78.539749
Functions in C

c

#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
void sampleFunction();

int main() {
   sampleFunction();
   return 0;
}

// Function definition
void sampleFunction() {
   printf("Hello from sampleFunction!\n");
}
Writing and Running a C Program
Write your code in a file with .c extension (e.g., hello.c)

Use text editors like vi, vim, Notepad++, or an IDE like Code::Blocks

Compile with a C compiler like gcc:


gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
